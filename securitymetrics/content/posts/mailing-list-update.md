Folks, the mailing list approval process is officially out of control. As you may know, we do not automatically approve applicants to the list because of my severe dislike of e-mail harvesting bots and marketeers, and because of a desire to ensure that the membership list is "clean."

Manual vetting is the only way to do this, at the present. Unfortunately, it means that I have to manually inspect every applicant's e-mail address. 

The queue of people who want to get in is -- and has been for a while -- about 175 deep. The queue is not getting smaller. This is officially a "success disaster." The situation isn't going to improve soon, either, until I get some more help with the mailing list. 

In the meantime, you can significantly increase your chances of being approved quickly by doing the following:

__Use your work e-mail address__

When you send an e-mail to the securitymetrics.org mailing list robot, use your _work_ e-email address. If it's from an organization I recognize, more than likely I'll just wave it through. I cannot stress this enough. The biggest challenge I have in investigating members is that lots of people use their home e-mail address, which might be hotmail or some random domain that you own. From the perspective of approval, random e-mail addresses stink because I don't know whether the owner is a real organization or a random e-mail harvesting bot. Examples of non-work addresses currently in the queue: `kevin at k2dd.com`, `francescofaenzi at gmail.com`, `rybolov at ryzhe.ath.cx`. Seriously, what sort of conclusions am I supposed to draw from these?

__Do not submit more than one request__

Trust me, I get every request that is submitted to the "discuss-request" mailing address. If you aren't approved immediately, it's because I did not recognize your name or e-mail address, and must investigate it manually. Do not send another one; it just means that I have to weed out your duplicate submission. Trust me when I tell you that I'll get to it when I can, which isn't nearly as often as I'd like.

__When all else fails, send me an e-mail to my work address directly__
In your e-mail, tell me who you are, and who you know. The more contextual information I have, the faster I'll be convinced that you are a real person. That address is `ajaquith at yankeegroup.com`. The instructions on the Mailing List page specified the wrong address (`arjaquith`). Sorry about that.

Sorry for appearing to be cranky. It's not so much crankiness as exasperation. This list has been wildly successful, and that's a tribute to the membership. But the process for adding new members isn't scaling well, and I hope you will bear with me for a little while longer.
