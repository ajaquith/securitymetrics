The following provides information on techniques for aggregating, refining, and reporting security metrics. Fair game for this page includes technologies for gathering and transforming raw data, generating reports, and creating security dashboards.

  This document provides guidance on how an organization, through the use of metrics, identifies  the adequacy of in-place security controls, policies, and procedures. It provides an approach to  help management decide where to invest in additional security protection resources or identify  and evaluate nonproductive controls. It explains the metric development and implementation  process and how it can also be used to adequately justify security control investments. The  results of an effective metric program can provide useful data for directing the allocation of  information security resources and should simplify the preparation of performance-related  reports.

  You need to measure something before you can manage it.  Metrics are the only way you can measure the quality of your network and its security.  It is the only way you can tell if the improvements to your security are working.  You need to be able to report this quality to your management and they mainly understand numbers, percentages, graphs and charts.  They need to know the threats to their network and the amount risk in not taking action to correct them.  Metrics can help you quantify this information.  This paper will provide you with information on how to implement a security metrics program that is based in part on the already extensive amount of information on software metric programs

  This paper focuses on the selection of good metrics. There is no magic bullet.  Many  metrics seem right and are easy to measure, but have subtle, counter-productive consequences.   Other metrics are more difficult to measure, but focus the enterprise on those decisions and  actions that are critical to success.  We suggest how to identify metrics that achieve balance in  these effects and enhance long-term profitability.  To gain an understanding of the properties of  good metrics we begin with a summary of how metrics fail.  These seven pitfalls provide  examples of where metrics have produced counter-productive results.  We then suggest a seven step system to design effective, &ldquo;lean&rdquo; metrics.

  This "business novel" launched a thousand careers in process improvement through metrics. It focuses on critical thinking skills and especially on defining the right questions to answer. A solid foundation for practical efforts at metrics.

  Security managers will, more than ever before, be held accountable for demonstrating the effectiveness of their security programs and the value of those programs to the  organization. Some experts believe that a key aspect of this accountability will be security metrics.  This guide provides a definition of security  metrics, explains their value, discusses the difficulties in generating them, and suggests a  methodology for building a security metrics program.

  This paper demonstrates the metrics development process by defining a goal of network integrity and building specific metrics to support the decisions of each principal security constituent.
