## Original Call for Participation

Metricon 5 is the fifth annual conference dedicated to security metrics. It is a forum for presenting new approaches for measuring information security effectiveness, with a bias towards practical, specific approaches. Topics and presentations will be selected for their novelty and merit, and their potential to stimulate discussion.

With five years of organized conferences in the history books, this year's theme, appropriately, is _Older But Wiser._ [Four years ago](/blog/2006/09/20/metricon-1/), presenters at the first Metricon discussed software security, benchmarking, identity management, enterprise case studies and many other topics. Since then, researchers and enterprises have continued to investigate new techniques. What have we learned? Given that we are trying to _measure_, measuring the security metrics field (and the success or failures of our own efforts) is also our responsibility.

The program is organized along three temporal perspectives:

* __Metrics Past__. Which metrics techniques from 2006 worked, and which did not? And how can knowledge of the past inform the present and future?
* __Metrics Present__. What is the state of the art as practiced ''today' by leading corporations, consultants and researchers?
* __Metrics Future__. What new strategies for measuring security will emerge in the future?

Metricon 5 will be a one-day event, Tuesday, August 10th, 2010, co-located with the 19th USENIX Security Symposium in Washington, DC (http://www.usenix.org/events/sec10/). Metricon will begin bright and early in the morning, continue through a catered lunch in meeting room, and extend into the evening with informal discussion. Attendance will be by invitation. Capacity is limited to 60 participants.

__Attendance__
Attendance is by invitation only. If you would like to attend, send an e-mail to `metricon5@securitymetrics.org`.

All participants will be expected to "come with findings" and be willing to contribute to group discussions. Politeness will be praised; questions, encouraged; lurkers, flushed out.
