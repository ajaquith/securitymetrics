## Original Call for Participation

Through the cooperation of RSA, the workshop will be held at the University of San Francisco, within walking distance of the Moscone Center, the location of the RSA Conference, to be held during the same week. Mini-Metricon attendees are eligible for free RSA exhibit passes.

Like its predecessors, Mini-Metricon 6.5 is an informal workshop designed to facilitate exchange of new ideas as well as practical experience in using metrics to drive better security, compliance, and risk management. The day will be divided between open/moderated exchange and short presentations. Participants are expected to come prepared to actively interact as either presenters or active listeners (or both).

This year, the Program Committee would especially like to request presentations that discuss __The Human in the Loop__.  We are soliciting papers that range from behavioral considerations that drive insider threats, to the use of social media for social engineering, to the ways that networks or software are exploited through human vulnerabilities.

If you would like to participate:
 
Due to space limitations, we are asking all who are interested in participating to send an email to mini-metricon@securitymetrics.org. In the email reques, please provide some information about who you are, your interest/experience with metrics, what metrics you can bring to discuss, and your preferred level of participation:

* presenter, or
* active audience participant.
 
Potential presenters must provide an abstract of 5 paragraphs or less that describes the nature of the metrics and metric results that you would like to present. 
 
Submission of recent, previously published work as well as simultaneous submissions to multiple venues is acceptable if disclosed in your proposal.
 
Potential active audience participants should indicate your area(s) of specific interest.
 
Following past Metricon practice, preference will be given to those who respond to this CfP with actual work in progress that demonstrates the value of security metrics with respect to a security-related goal.  

Visit [securitymetrics.org](/categories/metricon/) for digests, presentations, and handouts from past Metricon Workshops.

__Notification__

To get invitations out well beforehand, we&rsquo;d like all email submissions to be in-hand by January 2 and notifications are planned for January 15. However, we realize this is short notice and will hold a presentation slot or two to accommodate requests for invitation that come after January 2. These will be reviewed on first-come first serve until the program is full and/or the day of the event. Our goal is to send invitations to participate by January 15.

__Important Dates__

* 2 Jan 2012 -- Responses Due to this Call
* 15 Jan 2012 -- Notification of Acceptance
* 27 Feb 2012 -- Mini-Metricon 6.5 Workshop

Please feel free to contact the Program Chair Bryan Ware (`bware@dsbox.com`) with any questions. Inquiries beyond administrative matters will be forwarded to the Committee.
