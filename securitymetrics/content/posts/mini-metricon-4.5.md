## Original Call for Participation

Mini-Metricon 4.5 will be a one-day event, Monday, March 1, 2010, in San Francisco, California. Through the cooperation of RSA, the workshop will be held at the University of San Francisco, within walking distance of the Moscone Center, the location of the RSA Conference, to be held during the same week. Mini-Metricon attendees are eligible for free RSA exhibit passes.

Like its predecessors, Mini-Metricon 4.5 is an informal workshop designed to facilitate exchange of new ideas as well as practical experience in using metrics to drive better security, compliance, and risk management. The day will be divided between open/moderated exchange and short presentations. Participants are expected to come prepared to actively interact as either presenters or active listeners (or both).

Place: University of San Francisco (within walking distance of the Moscone Center) Time: 8:30am to 4:30pm

Participation: by invitation.

Attendance: Limited to 80 people

__If you would like to participate__

Due to space limitations, we are asking all who are interested in participating to send an email to `metricon4.5@SecurityMetrics.org`. Please provide some information about who you are, your interest/experience with metrics, what metrics you can bring to discuss, and your preferred level of participation: presenter or active audience participant.

_Presenters:_ Please provide an abstract of 5 paragraphs or less that describes the nature of the metrics and metric results that you would like to present. Following past Metricon practice, preference will be given to those who respond to this CfP with actual work in progress that demonstrates the value of security metrics with respect to a security-related goal. Submission of recent, previously published work as well as simultaneous submissions to multiple venues is acceptable if disclosed in your proposal.

_Active audience participants:_ Please indicate your area(s) of specific interest.
