## Data Breaches

* [Lost Customer Information: What Does a Data Breach Cost Companies?](http://www.securitymanagement.com/library/Ponemon_DataStudy0106.pdf), Ponemon Institute Survey sponsored by PGP Corporation, PDF. The Ponemon Institute&rsquo;s benchmark study, sponsored by PGP Corporation, examines the costs incurred by 14 companies that experienced a data breach. Results were not hypothetical responses to possible situations; they represent cost estimates for activities resulting from data loss incidents.

## Application Quality

* [Tangible ROI Through Secure Software Engineering](http://sbq.com/sbq/rosi/sbq_rosi_software_engineering.pdf), Soo Hoo K, Sudbury AW, & Jaquith AR, _Secure Business Quarterly_, 5 pp, Q2 2001, PDF. Securely engineering software to proactively fix problems has a concrete value. In this study of investments in security made during the design phase the authors show that ROI can be up to 21 percent.
* [The Economic Impact of Cyber Attacks](/attachments/Cashell-Economic-Impact-Cyberattacks.pdf), Cashell B, Jackson WD, Jickling M, & Baird W, Government and Finance Division, Congressional Research Service, The Library of Congress, document RL32331, 45 pp, 1 April 2004, PDF. This report surveys the state of knowledge on the cost of cyber-attacks and the economics of information security.
  * First, we summarize several studies that use stock market capitalization as a measure of the cost of cyber-attacks to victim firms.
  * Second, we present summaries of the existing empirical data on costs attributable to cyber-crime and computer worms and viruses.
  * Third, we analyze the reasons for the lack of statistical data.
  * Fourth, we examine the efforts of the insurance industry to develop policies that cover cyber-risk.
  * Finally, we consider cyber-attacks as macroeconomic events.
