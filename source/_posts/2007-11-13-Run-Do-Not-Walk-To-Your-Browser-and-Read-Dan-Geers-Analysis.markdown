Dan's a friend of mine, and we are both data junkies. Right about the same time I put the capper on a research report on malware trends (coming soon to Yankee Group subscribers), Dan releases this [tour de force](http://geer.tinho.net/trends.pdf), a masterful synthesis of a lot of other people's data. The upshot: things are getting worse.

Needless to say, it beats the pulp out of any of the other Internet security trend reports I've seen all year. Stupendous. I doff my feathered foofy cap in your general direction, sir Dan.
