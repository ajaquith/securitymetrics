This week, I am attending two security shows: the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) in Mountain View, and the CardTech show in San Francisco. Both of these venues offer contrasting views of the portable identity market, an area I cover professionally for Yankee Group. As many people who know me can personally testify, I like to count things. Here a few statistics that will probably interest only me:

<!--more-->

* \# attendees at Internet Identity Workshop: 150
* \# attendees from US Department of Defense: 1
* \# conference sessions on identity: about 40
* \# conference sessions explicitly devoted to identity theft and fraud: 1
* \# personal computers observed at general session, 10:10 AM today: 46
* % of general session computers that were Macs: 55% (25/46)
* % of Macs that were MacBook Pros (that is, less than a year old): 90%
* \# OpenID replying parties in November 2006: 550
* \# OpenID RPs today: 2500
* \# personal computers observed at Microsoft-sponsored working session on CardSpace: 14
* % of Macs at Microsoft session: 42% (6/14)
