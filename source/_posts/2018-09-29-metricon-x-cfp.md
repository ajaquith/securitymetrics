Securitymetrics.org was started by a group of obsessive security and risk professionals
way back in the dark ages of security &mdash; the early 2000s. The first gathering of &ldquo;security quants&rdquo; was held in September 2006, with eight more conferences following, plus 6 mini-conferences. As Metricon celebrates its tenth conference, it is worth reflecting on a body of practice that is now well over ten years old.

Metricon X will be held in March 2019. It will ask and answer the following questions:

<!-- more -->

- __Plus &ccedil;a change...__ Twelve years older, are we any wiser as a community?
- __Influence and persuasion__. What works? How do we communicate risk-through-numbers to the business?
- __Battle scars__. What lessons have we learned the hard way? What did you wish you had absorbed sooner?
- __Hopes and dreams__. Ten years from now, what would success look like?

We welcome submissions on security metrics success stories; lessons learned; practical examples that work; and progress on challenging problems that remain to be solved.

## Call for Participation

For the first time ever, Metricon X will be a 2-day event. It will be on March 21st and 22nd at [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu) in Hoboken, New Jersey.

Capacity is limited. If you would like to attend, send an e-mail to metriconx _at_ securitymetrics _dot_ org. In the email, please provide a short summary of your experience with security metrics, and areas of interest.

If you have a formal submission or specific concept you would like to see included in the agenda, please attach it to your email.

All participants are expected to &ldquo;come with findings&rdquo; and be willing to contribute to group discussions. Politeness will be praised; questions, encouraged; levity, welcomed; and lurkers, flushed out.
