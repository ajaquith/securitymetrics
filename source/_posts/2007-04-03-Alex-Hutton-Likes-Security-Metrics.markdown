Alex Hutton was one of the editorial reviewers for several chapters of _Security Metrics,_ and offered some excellent feedback during the writing stages. Now that the book has shipped, as a way of saying "thank-you" my publisher Addison-Wesley hooked him up with a copy. Alex [seems to like the rest of the book, too](http://riskmanagementinsight.com/riskanalysis/?p=143):

> Finally, I’d like to point you to this. It’s a book every analyst should own, written by a very smart person (Andrew Jaquith), and filled with - mostly - very good material... Metrics are great, but there are so many, many ways to get them wrong... Do go out and obtain a copy for yourself and/or your analysts. You won’t be disappointed. It’s one of those books you’ll actually use.

Thanks so much, Alex! When I see you at MetriCon 2.0 later this year, you've got a beer coming to you.
