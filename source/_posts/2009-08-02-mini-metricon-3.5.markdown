Please provide some information about who you are, what is your interest/experience with metrics, what metrics you can bring to discuss, and your preferred level of participation. Possible levels of participation include: presenter and active audience participant. 

_Presenters_:  Please provide an abstract of 5 paragraphs or less that describes the nature of the metrics and metric results that you would like to present.  Plagiarism is dishonest and the organizers of this workshop will take appropriate action if dishonesty of this sort is discovered.

__Criteria for evaluation__

Based on the results from a survey of interests of the securitymetrics.org community in the Nov-Dec 2008 timeframe, the Program Committee has defined the following criteria for evaluating proposals for participation in Metricon 3.5: 

_For presenters:_ The topics of highest interest, based upon survey results are case studies and metrics that matter -- defintions and how to interpret results. Selection criteria are:

* Is the material new?
* Is the material relevant to the topics of highest interest to the community?
* Is the material immediately useful?
* Is the matrical timely? Does it address current events and trends?

_For active audience participants:_ The primary criteria are willingness to share information--both good and bad--about their security metrics initiatives, whether thier respective programs are mature or just starting.
