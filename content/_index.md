Welcome to the Securitymetrics.org website.

This site hosts the web pages for the Securitymetrics.org. It is primarily an archive site, but may be updated from time to time. Andy Jaquith maintains this site. The mailing list is no longer available.

All historical content, including all [Metricon](/categories/metricon) event information and presentations, remains available; see the menu on the left side of the page. Historical mailing list archives may be added at a future time. For information about Securitymetrics.org, including why the organization was formed, see the About page [here](/about).

In November 2023, the previous website, which ran on its own server, was migrated to GitHub Pages. This website is serverless and statically generated.
