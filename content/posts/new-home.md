The website has been moved from a self-managed server to the serverless GitHub Pages. Content is now generated by Hugo rather than the the Jekyll-based Octopress. The mailing list is no longer available.

All historical content, including all Metricon event information and presentations, remains available; see the menu on the left side of the page. Historical mailing list archives may be added at a future time. With a few minor exceptions, permalinks from 2013 onward should still work.
