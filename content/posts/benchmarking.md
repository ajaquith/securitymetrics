Benchmarking generally refers to the process of ranking or scoring security against an established standard measure. Benchmarks can be absolute or cross-sectional.

## Comparative Application Security

* __The Security of Applications: Not All Are Created Equal__ (February 2002), Andrew Jaquith. This study examples the [security practices of 45 web applications](http://www.atstake.com/research/reports/acrobat/atstake_app_unequal.pdf), and finds that the most secure e-business applications have one-quarter as many security defects as the worst -- and eighty percent less risk.

## Benchmarking Goodness Criteria

Established by the [DBench Project](/pages/dbench.html).

<table class="table table-striped"><thead><tr><th>Criterion</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead>
<tr><td>Representativeness</td><td>how well inputs like workloads corresponds to real system characteristics</td></tr>
<tr><td>Repeatability</td><td>statistically equivalent results when run multilple times in the same environment</td></tr>
<tr><td>Reproducability</td><td>degree to which another party obtains statistically equivalent results when the benchmark is implemented from the same specifications</td></tr>
<tr><td>Portability</td><td>range of target systems to which benchmark specification applies to allow comparision</td></tr>
<tr><td>Non-Intrusiveness</td><td>requires minimum changes to target system and does not affect results</td></tr>
<tr><td>Scalability</td><td>ability to evaluate systems of different sizes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Time</td><td>time required to obtain the result</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cost</td><td>cost required to obtain result compared to value</td></tr>
